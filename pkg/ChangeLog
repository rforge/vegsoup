summary methods lost indentation due to cleaning code
implement method for class VegesoupPartion, to retrieve the partitioning method
we must rebuild polygons for coordinates<- method
decostand method for fidelity, needs to recalculate fidelity if not presence absence
more rigorous test for identical methods
generalize slot partition to contain class dendrogram, fuzzy memberships and maybe more?
peaks, if curve bends down return no peaks with option
implement math methods e.g. obj^0.2
implement CAP as decostand method
more rigorous tests of coverscale, eg. cov "++" is accepted but must raise errors!
add layers(obj) <- value logical-method, if FALSE collapse all layers
test if order of layers is consistent over all methods
