we must rebuild polygons for coordinates<- method
decostand method for fidelity, needs to recalculate fidelity if not presence absence
more rigorous test for identical methods
rename SpeciesList to taxalist
generalize slot partition to contain class dendrogram, fuzzy memberships and maybe more?
decotrans, better math method e.g. obj^0.2
peaks, if curve bends down return no peaks with option
more rigorous tests of coverscale, eg. cov "++" is accepted but must raise errors!
add layers(obj) <- value logical-method, if FALSE collapse all layers
