# drop
Association, is defined for nominal variables only?

# Latex.Rd
document
system.file("extdata", "template.tex", package = "vegsoup")

# rename
Species to species # done
Sites to sites
layer to stratum
Layers to strata
add strata(obj) <- value logical-method
if FALSE collapse all strata
if TRUE no method to add strata to unlayered object 
cov to abu(dance)? or val(ue)?

# add?
decotrans method, better math method e.g. obj^0.2
decostand method for fidelity, needs to recalculate fidelity if not presence absence

generalize slot partition to contain class dendrogram, fuzzy memberships and maybe more?

improve findcoordiantes(), or drop and replace it with coordinates<- method


more rigorous tests of coverscale
eg. cov "++" is accepted but must raise errors!

# minor
improve Spread()
search for 
Species(dta) <-

noquote for print method (e.g. as.matrix)
order method for Vegsoup object (plot, abbr, layer)?

# package check
tools::showNonASCII(readLines(f))

# coldiss should accept color
