# resolve ordering issue with class species

# drop
Association, is defined for nominal variables only?

# rename
layer to stratum
Layers to strata
SpeciesList to taxalist

add strata(obj) <- value logical-method
if FALSE collapse all strata
if TRUE no method to add strata to unlayered object 
cov to abu(dance)? or val(ue)?

# add?
show: class Species bring abundant/frequent to top
peaks: if curve bends down return no peaks with option
decotrans method, better math method e.g. obj^0.2
decostand method for fidelity, needs to recalculate fidelity if not presence absence

generalize slot partition to contain class dendrogram, fuzzy memberships and maybe more?

improve findcoordiantes(), or drop and replace it with coordinates<- method

more rigorous tests of coverscale
eg. cov "++" is accepted but must raise errors!

# minor
improve Spread()
search for 
Species(dta) <-

noquote for print method (e.g. as.matrix)
order method for Vegsoup object (plot, abbr, layer)?

# package check
tools::showNonASCII(readLines(f))

# coldiss should accept color
